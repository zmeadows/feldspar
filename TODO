make function to generate random game
^^ and test symmetry of evaluation: (eval(game) == -eval(game.flipped()))

save best line in GameTree

don't test for promotion during every pawn move check, do separate for loop

add quiscence search

clean up make_move

time management

eventually: disable array bounds check everywhere that is well-tested

test for search/evaluation: play random games against self and count white win/black win/draw count
